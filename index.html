    <p>in this we used to create a folder by cloning created repo from github using git clone url command </p>
    <p>then we have to add html and add in git by git add.</p>
    <p>now we have to commit by git commit -m "changes made" to save the changes</p>
    <p>then we can check status by git status</p>
    <p>we can check logs by git log</p>
